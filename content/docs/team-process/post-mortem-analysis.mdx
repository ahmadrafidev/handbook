# Post Mortem Analysis

Post-mortems are structured reviews of incidents that help teams learn and improve.

## What is a Post-Mortem?

A post-mortem is a written record of an incident that includes:
- What happened
- Why it happened
- How it was resolved
- What we learned
- How to prevent it

## Blameless Culture

### Core Principles
- **No blame**: Focus on systems, not people
- **Psychological safety**: Safe to admit mistakes
- **Learning opportunity**: Every incident teaches us
- **Continuous improvement**: Use insights to improve

### Why Blameless?
```
‚ùå Blame Culture:
"Who broke production?"
‚Üí People hide mistakes
‚Üí Less learning
‚Üí Slower improvement

‚úÖ Blameless Culture:
"What systemic issues led to this?"
‚Üí People share openly
‚Üí More learning
‚Üí Faster improvement
```

## Executive Summary

One paragraph summary of the incident, impact, and resolution.

## Timeline

All times in UTC.

**2024-01-15**
- 14:23 - Alert fired: High error rate on API
- 14:25 - Engineer paged, incident channel created
- 14:30 - Investigation began
- 14:45 - Root cause identified: Database connection pool exhausted
- 15:00 - Fix deployed: Increased pool size
- 15:15 - Service recovered
- 15:30 - Monitoring confirmed stability

## Impact

### Users Affected
- 45,000 users (approximately 30% of active users)
- 500 enterprise customers

### Business Impact
- $50,000 in estimated lost revenue
- 2,500 support tickets
- Negative social media mentions

### Technical Impact
- API response time: 200ms ‚Üí 30,000ms
- Error rate: 0.1% ‚Üí 45%
- Database connections: 100 ‚Üí 1,000 (max limit)

## Root Cause

### What Happened
A sudden spike in traffic (3x normal) caused the database connection pool to be exhausted. New requests couldn't acquire connections and timed out.

### Why It Happened
1. **Traffic spike**: Product launch drove unexpected traffic
2. **Insufficient capacity**: Connection pool sized for normal load
3. **No auto-scaling**: Pool size was hardcoded
4. **Monitoring gap**: No alert for connection pool saturation
5. **Load testing gap**: Launch traffic not load tested

### Contributing Factors
- Marketing campaign timing not communicated to engineering
- Previous capacity planning didn't account for product launches
- Lack of circuit breakers to fail gracefully

## Resolution

### Immediate Actions
1. Increased database connection pool: 100 ‚Üí 500
2. Restarted application servers to clear stuck connections
3. Enabled connection pooling metrics

### Short-term Fixes (Within 1 week)
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling for connection pool
- [ ] Add alerts for connection pool utilization (>80%)
- [ ] Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- [ ] Create runbook for similar incidents

### Long-term Improvements (Within 1 month)
- [ ] Implement connection pooling best practices
- [ ] Set up load testing pipeline
- [ ] Establish launch checklist with capacity planning
- [ ] Improve communication between marketing and engineering

## What Went Well

- **Fast detection**: Alert fired within 2 minutes
- **Quick escalation**: Right people paged immediately
- **Clear communication**: Regular updates in incident channel
- **Good collaboration**: Multiple teams worked together
- **Fast recovery**: Service restored in under 1 hour

## What Could Be Better

- **Prevention**: Could have been prevented with load testing
- **Monitoring**: Connection pool metrics weren't monitored
- **Communication**: Marketing didn't inform engineering of launch
- **Documentation**: No runbook for connection pool issues
- **Capacity**: Pool size wasn't reviewed before launch

## Lessons Learned

1. **Load test launches**: Always load test before product launches
2. **Monitor resources**: Track all critical resource pools
3. **Cross-team communication**: Establish launch communication protocol
4. **Fail gracefully**: Implement circuit breakers and backpressure
5. **Capacity planning**: Review capacity before major events

## Example Post-Mortem

```markdown
# Post-Mortem: Payment Processing Outage

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Duration:** 2 hours 15 minutes
**Severity:** Critical
**Author:** Jane Smith

## Executive Summary

On January 15, 2024, our payment processing system experienced a complete outage lasting 2 hours and 15 minutes. The outage affected all payment methods and impacted approximately 10,000 transactions. The root cause was an expired SSL certificate on our payment gateway. Total estimated impact: $150,000 in lost revenue.

## Timeline (UTC)

- **10:00** - SSL certificate expires (unnoticed)
- **10:15** - First payment failure reported by customer
- **10:20** - Alert fires: 100% payment error rate
- **10:22** - On-call engineer paged
- **10:25** - Incident declared, war room created
- **10:30** - Investigation begins
- **10:45** - Checked payment gateway logs
- **11:00** - Discovered SSL certificate error
- **11:15** - New certificate purchased and generated
- **11:30** - Certificate deployed to production
- **11:45** - Payment processing restored
- **12:00** - Monitoring confirms stability
- **12:15** - Incident resolved

## Impact

### User Impact
- 10,000 failed transactions
- 2,000 abandoned carts
- 500 support tickets
- Negative reviews on social media

### Business Impact
- $150,000 estimated lost revenue
- Reputational damage
- Lost customer trust
- 15 enterprise customers complained

### Technical Metrics
- Payment success rate: 99.9% ‚Üí 0%
- Error rate: 0.1% ‚Üí 100%
- Support ticket volume: 50/hour ‚Üí 500/hour

## Root Cause

### What Happened
The SSL certificate for our payment gateway expired at 10:00 UTC. All HTTPS connections to the payment processor failed with a certificate validation error, causing 100% of payments to fail.

### Why It Happened
1. **No renewal reminder**: Certificate expiry not tracked
2. **No monitoring**: No alert for certificate expiry
3. **Manual process**: Certificate renewal was manual
4. **Knowledge gap**: Only one person knew about renewal
5. **No automation**: No automated certificate rotation

### Why We Didn't Catch It
- Certificate expiry was not monitored
- No alerts configured for SSL issues
- Load testing used test environment (different cert)
- No pre-production validation of certificates

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix
1. Purchased new SSL certificate
2. Generated CSR and private key
3. Deployed certificate to production gateway
4. Validated HTTPS connections working
5. Monitored payment success rate recovery

### Preventing Recurrence

#### Short-term (This week)
- [x] Set up certificate expiry monitoring
- [x] Add alerts 30 days before expiry
- [x] Document certificate renewal process
- [x] Create runbook for certificate issues

#### Long-term (This month)
- [ ] Implement automated certificate renewal (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Set up certificate inventory system
- [ ] Add certificate validation to CI/CD
- [ ] Establish on-call playbook for SSL issues

## What Went Well

‚úÖ **Fast response**: Engineer responded in 2 minutes
‚úÖ **Clear communication**: Regular updates to stakeholders
‚úÖ **Good documentation**: Detailed incident log maintained
‚úÖ **Team collaboration**: Multiple teams worked together
‚úÖ **Customer service**: Support team handled inquiries well

## What Could Be Better

‚ùå **Prevention**: Should have been caught beforehand
‚ùå **Monitoring**: No certificate expiry monitoring
‚ùå **Automation**: Manual certificate management
‚ùå **Knowledge**: Single point of failure (one person knew)
‚ùå **Testing**: Production-like SSL config not tested

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Monitor Everything Critical
If it can cause an outage, monitor it. SSL certificates are critical infrastructure.

### 2. Automate Manual Processes
Manual processes are error-prone. Automate certificate renewal.

### 3. Share Knowledge
Don't let critical knowledge live in one person's head.

### 4. Test Realistically
Test environment should match production, including certificates.

### 5. Have Runbooks
Document resolution steps for common failure scenarios.

‚Üí "Add alerts for CPU >80% and memory >90%"

### ‚ùå Too Many Actions
20 action items that never get done
‚Üí 3-5 high-impact actions with owners

### ‚ùå No Follow-through
Action items created but not tracked
‚Üí Regular review until completion
