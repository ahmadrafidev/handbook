# Distributed Systems

Distributed systems involve multiple computers working together to appear as a single coherent system.

## Key Concepts

### CAP Theorem
You can only guarantee two of three:
- **C**onsistency: All nodes see the same data
- **A**vailability: Every request gets a response
- **P**artition Tolerance: System works despite network failures

### Eventual Consistency
Data will become consistent over time, but may be temporarily inconsistent.

### Strong Consistency
All reads return the most recent write.

## Common Challenges

### Network Failures
- Timeouts
- Packet loss
- Network partitions
- Latency

### Concurrent Operations
- Race conditions
- Deadlocks
- Distributed transactions

### Data Consistency
- Replication lag
- Conflict resolution
- Version vectors

## Patterns & Solutions

### Service Discovery
Automatically detect network locations of service instances.

### Load Balancing
Distribute requests across multiple servers.

### Circuit Breaker
Prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services.

### Saga Pattern
Manage distributed transactions with compensating actions.

### Event Sourcing
Store state as sequence of events.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate read and write models.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous
- REST APIs
- gRPC
- GraphQL

### Asynchronous
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Pub/Sub (Redis, Kafka)
- Event streaming

## Consensus Algorithms

### Raft
Leader-based consensus for log replication.

### Paxos
Distributed consensus protocol.

### Two-Phase Commit
Coordinate distributed transactions.

## Monitoring & Observability

- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Metrics collection
- Health checks

## Best Practices

- Design for failure
- Implement retries with exponential backoff
- Use idempotent operations
- Monitor system health
- Plan for scalability
- Document system architecture
