# Commit Message

Good commit messages are essential for understanding project history and collaborating effectively.

## Conventional Commits

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

## Examples

### Good Commit Messages

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration with Google

Implemented Google OAuth2 authentication flow including:
- Login button component
- Token exchange service
- User profile synchronization

Closes #123
```

```
fix(cart): resolve checkout calculation error

Fixed rounding error in tax calculation that caused
checkout totals to be incorrect for orders over $1000.

The issue was caused by premature rounding before
applying the tax multiplier.

Fixes #456
```

```
refactor: simplify user validation logic

Extracted validation rules into separate functions
for better testability and reusability.
```

### Avoid

```
"Fixed stuff"
"WIP"
"asdf"
"Updated code"
```

## Best Practices

### Do
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how

### Don't
- Mix multiple unrelated changes
- Use generic messages
- Include unnecessary details
- Forget to reference issues/tickets

## Atomic Commits

Each commit should represent one logical change:
- Easier to review
- Easier to revert
- Clearer history
- Better for cherry-picking

## Tools

- Commitizen: Interactive commit message CLI
- Commitlint: Enforce commit conventions
- Git hooks: Validate messages before commit
