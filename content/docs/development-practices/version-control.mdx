# Version Control

Version control is essential for managing code changes, collaborating with teams, and maintaining project history.

## Git Fundamentals

### Core Concepts
- Commits: Snapshots of your code
- Branches: Parallel development lines
- Merges: Combining changes
- Remote repositories: Shared code storage

## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
    ├── feature/user-authentication
    ├── feature/payment-integration
    └── hotfix/security-patch
```

### GitHub Flow
- Simple, trunk-based development
- Feature branches off main
- Pull requests for review
- Deploy from main

### Trunk-Based Development
- Short-lived feature branches
- Continuous integration
- Feature flags for incomplete work

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve memory leak in image processing
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify payment validation logic
```

### Branching Conventions
```
feature/feature-name
bugfix/bug-description
hotfix/critical-fix
release/v1.2.0
```

## Tools & Workflows
- Git hooks for automation
- Rebase vs merge strategies
- Cherry-picking commits
- Stashing work in progress
