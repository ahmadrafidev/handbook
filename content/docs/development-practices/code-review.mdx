# Code Review

Code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality, knowledge sharing, and team growth.

## Purpose of Code Reviews

- Catch bugs and logic errors early
- Ensure code quality and consistency
- Share knowledge across the team
- Improve overall codebase maintainability

## Review Checklist

### Functionality
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?

### Code Quality
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Are naming conventions followed?
- Is there unnecessary complexity?
- Are there code smells?

### Testing
- Are there adequate tests?
- Do tests cover edge cases?
- Are tests meaningful and maintainable?

### Performance
- Are there obvious performance issues?
- Are database queries optimized?
- Is caching used appropriately?

### Security
- Are there security vulnerabilities?
- Is user input validated?
- Are secrets properly managed?

## Best Practices

### For Authors
- Keep changes small and focused
- Provide context in the PR description
- Self-review before requesting review
- Be open to feedback

### For Reviewers
- Be respectful and constructive
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Distinguish between blocking and non-blocking comments
- Respond in a timely manner

## Review Comments

### Good Examples
```
"Consider using a Set here for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) 
with array.includes(). This will improve performance when 
the array grows large."
```

### Avoid
```
"This is wrong."
"Why did you do it this way?"
```

## Automation

Use automated tools to catch common issues:
- Linters (ESLint, Biome)
- Formatters (Prettier)
- Type checkers (TypeScript)
- Security scanners
