# ISO

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards provide frameworks for quality, security, and process management.

## Common ISO Standards

### ISO 9001 - Quality Management
Framework for consistent quality in products and services.

#### Core Principles
- Customer focus
- Leadership
- Engagement of people
- Process approach
- Improvement
- Evidence-based decisions
- Relationship management

#### Implementation
```markdown
1. Define quality objectives
2. Document processes
3. Implement controls
4. Monitor performance
5. Continuous improvement
```

### ISO 27001 - Information Security
Framework for managing information security.

#### Key Controls
- Access control
- Cryptography
- Physical security
- Operations security
- Communications security
- Incident management
- Business continuity
- Compliance

#### Example Controls
```typescript
// Access Control
interface AccessControl {
  // Control user access
  authenticateUser(credentials: Credentials): boolean
  
  // Enforce least privilege
  authorizeAction(user: User, resource: Resource): boolean
  
  // Review access rights
  auditAccess(user: User): AccessLog[]
  
  // Revoke access
  revokeAccess(user: User, resource: Resource): void
}

// Cryptography
interface Cryptography {
  // Encrypt sensitive data
  encryptData(data: string, key: string): string
  
  // Secure key management
  rotateKeys(): void
  
  // Hash passwords
  hashPassword(password: string): string
}

// Incident Management
interface IncidentManagement {
  // Detect incidents
  detectIncident(event: SecurityEvent): Incident | null
  
  // Respond to incidents
  respondToIncident(incident: Incident): Response
  
  // Log incidents
  logIncident(incident: Incident): void
  
  // Review lessons learned
  reviewIncident(incident: Incident): LessonsLearned
}
```

### ISO 20000 - IT Service Management
Framework for delivering quality IT services.

#### Service Management Processes
- Service desk
- Incident management
- Problem management
- Change management
- Release management
- Capacity management
- Availability management

### ISO 22301 - Business Continuity
Framework for business continuity management.

#### Key Components
```markdown
1. Risk Assessment
   - Identify threats
   - Assess impact
   - Prioritize risks

2. Business Impact Analysis
   - Critical functions
   - Recovery objectives
   - Resource requirements

3. Continuity Strategies
   - Backup systems
   - Alternative facilities

   - Scenario testing
   - Update plans
```

## ISO Certification Process

### 1. Gap Analysis
```markdown
Current State → Identify Gaps → Define Actions

Example:
- Current: No formal security policy
- Gap: ISO 27001 requires documented policies
- Action: Create and approve security policy
```

### 2. Implementation
```markdown
- Document processes
- Train employees
- Implement controls
- Gather evidence
- Conduct internal audits
```

### 3. Certification Audit

#### Stage 1: Documentation Review
```markdown
Auditor reviews:
- Policies and procedures
- Process documentation
- Evidence of implementation
- Internal audit results
```

#### Stage 2: Implementation Audit
```markdown
Auditor verifies:
- Processes are followed
- Controls are effective
- Evidence is maintained
- Continuous improvement
```

### 4. Certification
```markdown
✅ Pass: Certificate issued (valid 3 years)
❌ Fail: Address non-conformities and re-audit
```

### 5. Surveillance Audits
```markdown
Year 1: Surveillance audit
Year 2: Surveillance audit
Year 3: Re-certification audit
```
