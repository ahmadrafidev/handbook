# Software Architecture

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of software systems and the discipline of creating such structures.

## Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture
```
Presentation Layer
    ↓
Business Logic Layer
    ↓
Data Access Layer
    ↓
Database
```

### Microservices
- Independent, deployable services
- Single responsibility
- Decentralized data management
- Service communication via APIs

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Asynchronous communication
- Loose coupling
- Event producers and consumers
- Message queues/brokers

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- Core business logic isolated
- External dependencies as adapters
- Testable and flexible

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Avoid code duplication through abstraction and reusability.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Favor simplicity over complexity.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't add functionality until it's necessary.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document important architectural decisions:
- Context: What is the issue?
- Decision: What did we decide?
- Consequences: What are the impacts?

## Common Patterns

### Repository Pattern
Abstracts data access logic.

### Factory Pattern
Creates objects without specifying exact class.

### Observer Pattern
Defines subscription mechanism for events.

### Strategy Pattern
Defines family of algorithms, makes them interchangeable.

## Trade-offs

Every architectural decision involves trade-offs:
- Performance vs Scalability
- Consistency vs Availability (CAP theorem)
- Complexity vs Flexibility
- Cost vs Quality

## Documentation

- Architecture diagrams (C4 model)
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- Deployment architecture
