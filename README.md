# devbook - an opinionated engineering handbook

## motivation

DevBook is a dynamic digital notebook where I document and share my ongoing exploration in the field of Software Engineering. This is more than just a collection of notes, it's a living archive of the skills, insights, and experiences I've gathered through internships, mentorships, college courses, and self-study.

At its core, DevBook is my personal commitment to lifelong learning and the open sharing of knowledge. It is a space where I track my growth, organize complex concepts, and reflect on the lessons learned from real-world experiences. By sharing this journey publicly, I hope to inspire others to pursue their passions, embrace curiosity, and continuously improve themselves.
